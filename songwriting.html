              <h2>Black Box Songwriters</h2>
              <p>Three groups of musicians, each with quite the diverse composition, were asked to create a song that began with two people "in different corners"...both in musical style and circumstance...but coming together at the end (both musically and in perspective) with the realization they weren't as different as they thought they were...</p>

              <strong>Expectations:</strong>  
              <p>Eleanor Marcus, Christian Jarrell, Tyler Lauro   (6:15-6:35 & 7:20-7:40)</p>
              <p>From Ellie..."Our song was written from the perspective of two different people who both felt as though the outside pressures on them were not equal to their capabilities.  The first perspective of the song (Ellie+Tyler) was written about too much expected, while the second part (Christian) was about people underestimating his ability to succeed.  Both pieces start out contrasting each other lyrically and in music, but they come together as both Ellie's and Christian's perspectives realize while their pressures from the outside are different, they are both going to do their own thing regardless of what people expect from them
              </p>
              <p><strong>Just Enough:</strong>  Luke Santos, Aiden Ostapko, Olivia Ritchey    (6:40-6:55 & 7:45-8:00)</p>
                <p>From Luke..."We wrote from the perspectives of one individual who says too much and another individual who says too little. Timidly or boisterously, everyone just wants their voices to be heard and have different ways of achieving that goal."</p>

                <p><strong>Different:</strong>  Alex Mbuthia, Jalen Peterson, Aaron Sprauve    (7:00-7:15 & 8:05-8:20)
              From Alex..."Jalen and I started writing this song as a way to abstractly illustrate what it is like to be a person of color in a predominantly white community, something that we have both gone through. The different perspectives we show is one of someone who's always on the outside and has trouble finding a place to fit in, and one of someone who changes themselves to fit in and end up losing themselves in the process. The realization both people come to is that staying true to yourself is the most important thing regardless of social status."
