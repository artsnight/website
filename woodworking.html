							<h1>Visual Arts</h1>
							<p>Welcome to our little worlds...Each Visual Arts Foundational Studio student created a “You” box; the two main criteria were to cover all visible sides and incorporate Spartan colors (blue and white) to unify the installation.  In combining all the boxes we created an installation which is representative of the diversity in personality traits within our school community.  


Changing Traits - The students in Visual Arts Studio 2 created an interactive installation where the viewer can rotate each box to reveal a variety of personality traits. To provide a fun visual representation of these various traits the students choose to select familiar and popular characters. Give it a whirl to come up with a funky looking character.  




Want to be an artist? A musician? A scientist? or a Literary Character? The Visual Arts Studio 3 and 4 students have created large panels which give the viewer the chance to “try on” different characters each with their own unique traits. Give it a try and even take a photo! 


Basic Human Needs - Wander through this hanging installation which was created by Visual Arts Studio 3 and 4. Each banner is representative of what every human needs in their life journey. This piece is a great experience to contemplate how we view these basic needs in our life. It is also an opportunity to examine our global community; reflecting upon the accessibility to these basic human needs for all individuals.
